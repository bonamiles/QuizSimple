# QuizSimple

This is a C# Program i wrote to display quiz questions and compare the answers from user to those saved on a database I created. 
Its a preety simple program.
Providing the source file wont work on other systems since i used hard coded paths to my computer SQL server database so i provided an installable file. You can still request for source files.
